Set your Windows desktop background image to a ongoing game of Go!

## Setup
You will need to download and install some Go engine. Testing was performed on KataGo OpenCL, but feel free to
experiment with your own.

[KataGo Downloads](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases)
Make sure you have the engine, model, and config files.

Once downloaded, replace the path to these in `start_engine.py`.
Install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, then run `main.py`!
